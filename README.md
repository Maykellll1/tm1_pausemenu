# Pause Menu

**TM1 Pause Menu** is a menu accessible by pressing the escape key, allowing quick shortcuts to actions frequently used on the server. Among these actions are:

* **Map:** Allows quick access to the map.
* **Settings:** Refers to the main game settings.
* **Keybindings:** Quick access to configure the keybindings for our game.
* **Exit:** Allows us to quickly leave the server.

In addition to these options, it also provides access to websites and social media, including:

* Discord
* Instagram
* X
* Own Website

All these options can be disabled simply by setting the value of the variable to null in the config.

It also displays the main job as if we have a dual job system; all of this is configurable since the code is accessible. We can also see the following fields:

* Name
* Main Job
* Secondary Job
* Money in Bank
* Cash on Hand
* Black Money
* VIP Money

Last but not least, we can also access services such as mechanic, EMS, and police, allowing us to see at all times whether these services are available or not. Additionally, we can see the number of players online at that moment.

The menu also features background music that can be changed to the client's liking, with the file named background.mp3.

The interface is programmed in React with TypeScript, so it is recommended to have knowledge in case you want to modify it.

This is a script versioning the source script in the pause menu but with improved aspects.
The code is entirely your own.
